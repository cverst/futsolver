A nearly completed but never finished method to solve Fifa Ultimate Team Squad Building Challenges (FUT SBCs).

This repository uses constraint programming with Google OR tools to find puzzle solutions: the "cheapest" set of players that collectively meet specific criteria. The player list to select from contains 15k-20k records and each have an individual price, while the number of players to select goes up to 11.
